# Car-Facial-Recognition
Facial recognition is a technology we have been accepting more and more into our daily lives, anywhere from laptops that come equipped with a camera, to the smartphones we all carry around daily. That is why I found a way to work it into one of my other passions, I used facial recognition to start a vehicle. This is done using OpenCV’s libraries, “neural network” using HOG classification; processed on a Raspberry PI; to determine if the “driver” is “safe” it will start the vehicle but if the driver is “unsafe” they would have to turn a key.
